# Coffee Shop Project

I got this idea from a local coffee shop I love to go. They have a online ordering system, that I feel could be better. I thought it would be a great learning project to build a coffee shop site, that lets a customer order food/coffee. This order will also appear on a screen that would be logged into by employees to see what they need to make next.
